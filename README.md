# Analysis-of-Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction-
Several bike/scooter ride sharing facilities (e.g., Bird, Capital Bikeshare, Citi Bike) have started up lately especially in metropolitan cities like San Francisco, New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, and one of the most important problem from a business point of view is to predict the bike demand on any particular day. While having excess bikes results in wastage of resource (both with respect to bike maintenance and the land/bike stand required for parking and security), having fewer bikes leads to revenue loss (ranging from a short term loss due to missing out on immediate customers to potential longer term loss due to loss in future customer base), Thus, having a estimate on the demands would enable efficient functioning of these companies.
